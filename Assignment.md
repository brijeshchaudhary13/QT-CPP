## **Assignment 1: Directory Management Application**

### **Objective**

Create a GUI-based application to manage directories.

### **Requirements**

1. Create a directory at a user-specified location.
2. Delete an existing directory.
3. Validate directory name and path (should not be empty).
4. Show proper success and error messages.
5. Use Qt GUI components (buttons, text fields, labels).

### **Expected Outcome**

* User can add a new directory.
* User can delete a selected directory.
* Application handles invalid inputs gracefully.

## **Assignment 2: Login Application**

### **Objective**

Develop a modern login application using Qt GUI.

### **Functional Requirements**

1. Validate login credentials:

   * If the password is correct, allow login.
2. Username and password fields must not be empty.
3. On successful login, navigate to a **Welcome Screen**.
4. Use icons for:

   * Username field
   * Password field
   * Show password
   * Hide password
5. Provide a show/hide password functionality.
6. Display error messages for invalid credentials.

### **UI Requirements**

* Login form should be centered on the screen.
* Clean and modern UI design.
* Proper alignment of labels and input fields.

### **Expected Outcome**

* User logs in only with valid credentials.
* Smooth navigation from Login Screen to Welcome Screen.
* Password visibility toggle works correctly.

## **Assignment 3: Data Handling and Table Display (Without SQL)**

### **Objective**

After successful login, read data and display it in a table format without using SQL.

### **Requirements**

1. Read data from a file (e.g., text file, CSV, or in-memory data).
2. Store data using C++ data structures (e.g., arrays, vectors, structs).
3. Perform SQL-like operations:

   * Insert data
   * Delete data
   * Update data
   * Search/filter records
4. Display data using a table view (Qt Table Widget or Model-View approach).
5. Allow sorting and basic filtering of data.

### **Constraints**

* Do **not** use any SQL database.
* Data handling should be done using core C++ logic.

### **Expected Outcome**

* Data is displayed in a tabular format.
* Application behaves like a database system without SQL.
* Clean and readable table UI.
