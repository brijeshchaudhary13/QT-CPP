# Chapter 4 — Qt Project Structure

---

# 1. Introduction

A Qt project is more than a collection of `.cpp` files.

It typically contains:

```text
Project

│

├── Source Files

├── Header Files

├── UI Files

├── Resource Files

├── Translation Files

├── Build Files

├── Generated Files

└── Assets
```

Each type of file has a specific purpose.

---

# 2. Anatomy of a Qt Project

A simple Qt Widgets application might look like this:

```text
Calculator/

│

├── CMakeLists.txt

├── main.cpp

├── mainwindow.h

├── mainwindow.cpp

├── mainwindow.ui

├── resources.qrc

├── icons/

│   ├── add.png

│   └── sub.png

├── translations/

│   └── calculator_en.ts

└── build/
```

---

```

---

# 3. Source Files (`.cpp`)

## Definition

`.cpp` files contain the implementation of your classes and functions.

Example:

```cpp
#include "mainwindow.h"

MainWindow::MainWindow(QWidget *parent)
    : QMainWindow(parent)
{
}
```

---

## Responsibilities

* Function definitions
* Business logic
* Event handling
* Algorithms
* UI interaction
* Database operations
* Networking
* Rendering

---

## Typical Project

```text
src/

main.cpp

mainwindow.cpp

login.cpp

database.cpp

network.cpp
```

---

# 4. Header Files (`.h`)

Headers define the interface of a class.

Example:

```cpp
class MainWindow : public QMainWindow
{
    Q_OBJECT

public:
    MainWindow(QWidget *parent = nullptr);

private:
    Ui::MainWindow *ui;
};
```

---

## Responsibilities

* Class declarations
* Function declarations
* Member variables
* Enumerations
* Templates
* Constants

---

# Header Dependency

```text
mainwindow.cpp

↓

#include "mainwindow.h"

↓

Compiler knows class definition
```

---

# 5. UI Files (`.ui`)

A `.ui` file is an XML document created by Qt Designer.

Example:

```text
mainwindow.ui
```

Internally:

```xml
<ui version="4.0">
    ...
</ui>
```

---

## Purpose

Describe the widget hierarchy.

Instead of writing:

```cpp
QPushButton *button =
    new QPushButton(this);
```

You drag a button onto the form in Designer.

---

## Workflow

```text
Qt Designer

↓

mainwindow.ui

↓

uic

↓

ui_mainwindow.h

↓

Compiler
```

We'll explore `uic` in detail later.

---

# 6. Resource Files (`.qrc`)

Qt embeds application resources into the executable.

Example:

```xml
<RCC>
    <qresource prefix="/">
        <file>icons/open.png</file>
        <file>icons/save.png</file>
    </qresource>
</RCC>
```

---

## Advantages

* No need to ship separate image files (unless desired).
* Resources are platform-independent.
* Simplifies deployment.

---

## Usage

```cpp
QIcon icon(":/icons/open.png");
```

The `:/` prefix indicates a Qt resource.

---

# Resource Flow

```text
Image

↓

resources.qrc

↓

rcc

↓

Compiled Resource

↓

Executable
```

---

# 7. Translation Files (`.ts`, `.qm`)

Qt supports internationalization.

### `.ts`

Human-readable XML translation source.

Example:

```text
app_en.ts
```

---

### `.qm`

Compiled binary translation file.

Generated from `.ts`.

Used at runtime.

---

Workflow:

```text
Source Code

↓

lupdate

↓

.ts

↓

Qt Linguist

↓

lrelease

↓

.qm

↓

Application
```

---

# 8. Meta-Object Compiler (`moc`)

One of Qt's most important tools.

Input:

```cpp
class MyClass : public QObject
{
    Q_OBJECT
};
```

Output:

```text
moc_MyClass.cpp
```

`moc` generates code for:

* Signals
* Slots
* Runtime type information
* Properties
* Meta-object data

---

## Workflow

```text
Header

↓

Q_OBJECT

↓

moc

↓

Generated C++

↓

Compiler
```

We'll dedicate **Chapter 12** to MOC internals.

---

# 9. User Interface Compiler (`uic`)

Input:

```text
mainwindow.ui
```

Output:

```text
ui_mainwindow.h
```

Generated code creates the widget hierarchy described in the `.ui` file.

Conceptually:

```text
UI XML

↓

uic

↓

C++ Header

↓

Compiler
```

---

# 10. Resource Compiler (`rcc`)

Input:

```text
resources.qrc
```

Output:

Compiled C++ resource data.

This allows:

```cpp
QPixmap(":/images/logo.png");
```

without requiring the image to exist as a separate file at runtime.

---

# 11. Build Folder

Modern Qt projects use **out-of-source builds**.

Example:

```text
Project/

│

├── src/

├── CMakeLists.txt

└── build/
```

Build directory contains:

```text
build/

│

├── CMakeCache.txt

├── CMakeFiles/

├── Makefile (or Ninja files)

├── moc_*.cpp

├── ui_*.h

├── *.obj / *.o

├── executable

└── libraries
```

Never place generated files in your source tree.

---

# Why Out-of-Source Builds?

Advantages:

* Clean repository.
* Easy cleanup.
* Multiple build configurations.

Example:

```text
Project/

build-debug/

build-release/

build-clang/

build-msvc/
```

Each build directory is independent.

---

# 12. CMake Project Structure

Typical structure:

```text
MyProject/

│

├── CMakeLists.txt

├── src/

├── include/

├── resources/

├── translations/

├── tests/

└── docs/
```

Example:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.21)

project(MyApp)

find_package(Qt6 REQUIRED COMPONENTS
    Core
    Gui
    Widgets)

add_executable(MyApp
    src/main.cpp
    src/mainwindow.cpp
)

target_link_libraries(MyApp PRIVATE
    Qt6::Core
    Qt6::Gui
    Qt6::Widgets)
```

---

# 13. qmake Project Structure

Legacy Qt projects often use:

```text
MyProject/

│

├── MyProject.pro

├── src/

├── include/

├── forms/

└── resources/
```

Example:

```pro
QT += core gui widgets

SOURCES += \
    src/main.cpp \
    src/mainwindow.cpp

HEADERS += \
    include/mainwindow.h

FORMS += \
    forms/mainwindow.ui

RESOURCES += \
    resources/resources.qrc
```

---

# 14. Enterprise Folder Structure

For medium and large applications, separate code by responsibility.

```text
MyApplication/

│

├── CMakeLists.txt

├── src/

├── include/

├── ui/

├── resources/

├── translations/

├── tests/

├── docs/

├── third_party/

├── scripts/

├── cmake/

├── plugins/

└── build/
```

For very large systems, use modules:

```text
MedicalTPS/

│

├── Core/

├── GUI/

├── DoseEngine/

├── DICOM/

├── Database/

├── Networking/

├── Planning/

├── Reports/

└── Tests/
```

We'll revisit enterprise architecture in **Chapter 131**.

---

# 15. Generated Files

Generated files should **never be edited manually**.

Examples:

```text
moc_MainWindow.cpp

ui_MainWindow.h

qrc_resources.cpp
```

They are recreated whenever the build system runs the appropriate tools.

---

# 16. Build Flow

The complete build process looks like this:

```text
Source Files
Headers
UI Files
Resource Files

        │

        ▼

CMake / qmake

        │

        ▼

moc
uic
rcc

        │

        ▼

Generated C++ Files

        │

        ▼

Compiler

        │

        ▼

Object Files

        │

        ▼

Linker

        │

        ▼

Executable
```

This pipeline is one of the most important concepts in Qt.

# 17. Qt 5.15 vs Qt 6.11

| Topic                       | Qt 5.15   | Qt 6.11              |
| --------------------------- | --------- | -------------------- |
| Project Structure           | ✔         | ✔                    |
| `.cpp`, `.h`, `.ui`, `.qrc` | ✔         | ✔                    |
| `moc`, `uic`, `rcc`         | ✔         | ✔                    |
| qmake                       | Primary   | Legacy support       |
| CMake                       | Supported | Primary build system |

There is **no fundamental difference** in the purpose of project files between Qt 5.15 and Qt 6.11.

The biggest change is that **CMake has become the recommended build system** for Qt 6.

# 18. Best Practices

* Use out-of-source builds.
* Keep generated files out of version control.
* Organize code into logical folders.
* Separate headers and source files.
* Use descriptive resource prefixes.
* Store UI files in a dedicated `ui/` directory.
* Place translations in a `translations/` directory.
* Prefer CMake for new projects.

---

# 19. Common Mistakes

* Editing generated files (`ui_*.h`, `moc_*.cpp`).
* Placing build artifacts inside the source directory.
* Mixing source code with generated files.
* Using absolute file paths instead of resources.
* Committing build directories to Git.

---

# 20. Interview Questions

## Easy

1. What is a `.ui` file?
2. What is a `.qrc` file?
3. What does `moc` do?

## Medium

1. Explain the difference between `uic` and `moc`.
2. Why should generated files not be edited?
3. Why are out-of-source builds recommended?

## Hard

1. Describe the complete Qt build pipeline.
2. Explain how `rcc` embeds resources into an executable.
3. Compare CMake and qmake project organization.

## Expert

1. Design a scalable folder structure for a 500,000-line Qt application.
2. Explain how Qt build tools cooperate during compilation.
3. Describe how you would organize a multi-module medical TPS project using CMake.

---

# 21. Revision Notes

* A Qt project consists of source, headers, UI, resources, translations, and build files.
* `.ui` files are XML descriptions of widget layouts.
* `.qrc` files embed application resources.
* `moc`, `uic`, and `rcc` generate C++ code during the build.
* Use out-of-source builds to keep repositories clean.
* Prefer CMake for new projects.
* Never edit generated files manually.
