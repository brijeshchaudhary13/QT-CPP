Excellent. Now we are moving to the **foundation of the entire Qt framework**.

Most developers know:

```cpp
QApplication app(argc, argv);
```

Very few know that internally:

```text
QApplication
        ▲
        │
QGuiApplication
        ▲
        │
QCoreApplication
```

Everything starts with **QCoreApplication**.

If you remove GUI support from Qt, **QCoreApplication** is still enough to build:

* Console applications
* Background services
* Daemons
* Servers
* REST APIs
* TCP Servers
* Embedded applications
* IoT applications

As a **Senior Qt Architect**, I can confidently say:

> **QCoreApplication is one of the five most important classes in Qt.**

# 1. Introduction

## Definition

`QCoreApplication` is the **base class** for every Qt application.

Header

```cpp
#include <QCoreApplication>
```

Module

```
QtCore
```

CMake

```cmake
find_package(Qt6 REQUIRED COMPONENTS Core)

target_link_libraries(MyApp PRIVATE Qt6::Core)
```

qmake

```pro
QT += core
```

---

Unlike `QApplication`

```
No Widgets

No Windows

No Buttons

No Menus
```

It provides:

* Event loop
* Timers
* Signals and Slots
* Event delivery
* Command-line parsing
* Application information
* Plugin search paths

---

# 2. Why QCoreApplication?

Suppose you're writing

```
TCP Server

REST API

Background Service

Database Synchronizer

DICOM Server

Dose Engine

Console Tool
```

There is **no GUI**.

Why initialize:

```
Fonts

Clipboard

Windows

Mouse

Keyboard

Styles
```

Unnecessary.

Instead

```cpp
QCoreApplication app(argc, argv);
```

Much lighter.

# 6. Creating QCoreApplication

Basic

```cpp
int main(int argc,char* argv[])
{
    QCoreApplication app(argc,argv);

    return app.exec();
}
```

---

Timer Example

```cpp
#include <QCoreApplication>
#include <QTimer>

int main(int argc,char* argv[])
{
    QCoreApplication app(argc,argv);

    QTimer::singleShot(3000,
                       &app,
                       &QCoreApplication::quit);

    return app.exec();
}
```

Execution

↓

↓

```

# 7. Command Line Arguments

Retrieve arguments

```cpp
QStringList args =
    QCoreApplication::arguments();
```

Example

```
DoseEngine.exe patient.dcm plan.dcm
```

Returns

```
DoseEngine.exe

patient.dcm

plan.dcm
```

---

Typical Uses

```
Input Files

Configuration

Debug Flags

Patient ID

Batch Mode
```

---

# 8. Application Metadata

Set application name

```cpp
QCoreApplication::setApplicationName(
    "DoseEngine");
```

Organization

```cpp
QCoreApplication::setOrganizationName(
    "Panacea");
```

Domain

```cpp
QCoreApplication::setOrganizationDomain(
    "panaceamedical.com");
```

Version

```cpp
QCoreApplication::setApplicationVersion(
    "1.0");
```

---

Retrieve

```cpp
qDebug()
<< QCoreApplication::applicationName();
```

---

Used by

```
QSettings

Logging

Plugins

Configuration

Crash Reports
```

---

# 9. Global Instance

Get application object

```cpp
QCoreApplication* app =
    QCoreApplication::instance();
```

Convenience macro

```cpp
qApp
```

> **Note:** `qApp` resolves to the current application object. In Widgets applications it points to a `QApplication`; in non-GUI applications it refers to the underlying application instance. Use it only when appropriate for the application type.

---

# 10. Event Loop

Start

```cpp
app.exec();
```

Flow

```

# 11. Library Paths

Qt searches for plugins

```
Image Formats

SQL Drivers

Platform Plugins

Styles

TLS Plugins
```

Retrieve

```cpp
QStringList paths =
    QCoreApplication::libraryPaths();
```

Add

```cpp
QCoreApplication::addLibraryPath(
    "./plugins");
```

Useful when deploying applications with custom plugin locations.

# 12. Qt 5.15 vs Qt 6.11

| Feature          | Qt5 | Qt6 |
| ---------------- | --- | --- |
| QCoreApplication | ✔   | ✔   |
| Event Loop       | ✔   | ✔   |
| Timers           | ✔   | ✔   |
| Metadata         | ✔   | ✔   |
| Plugin Paths     | ✔   | ✔   |

There is **no major functional difference** between Qt 5.15 and Qt 6.11 for `QCoreApplication`.

Qt 6 includes internal modernization and broader platform improvements, but the public API and programming model remain largely the same.

---

# 13. Best Practices

✅ Create only one application object.

✅ Create it before using most Qt facilities.

✅ Use `QCoreApplication` for non-GUI programs.

✅ Store application metadata early in `main()`.

✅ Return:

```cpp
return app.exec();
```

instead of calling `exec()` without returning its result.

---

# 14. Common Mistakes

Creating

```cpp
QWidget widget;
```

inside

```cpp
QCoreApplication
```

Not allowed.

Widgets require:

```cpp
QApplication
```

---

Blocking

```cpp
while(true)
{
}
```

Blocks the event loop.

---

Creating

```
Multiple
QCoreApplication
Objects
```

Not allowed.

Only one application object can exist.

---

2. What are application metadata APIs?
3. How do you access command-line arguments?

---

## Hard

1. Explain the startup sequence.
2. Describe the internal architecture.
3. Explain plugin library paths.

---

## Expert

1. Design a console-based DICOM processing application using `QCoreApplication`.
2. Explain why `QApplication` inherits from `QCoreApplication`.
3. Discuss how `QCoreApplication` enables cross-platform event processing without GUI support.

# 16. Revision Notes

* `QCoreApplication` is the foundation of all Qt application classes.
* It provides the event loop, timers, command-line handling, metadata, and plugin path management.
* It does **not** initialize GUI functionality.
* Use it for console applications, services, and background processes.
* Only one application instance is allowed.
* `exec()` starts the core event loop.

This architecture is common when separating the computational engine from the graphical user interface.
